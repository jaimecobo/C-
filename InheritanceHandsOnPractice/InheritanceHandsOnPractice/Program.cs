//Part 1
//Create a base class named Employee(don't forget the constructor).
//This class should contain the following string variables:
//name
//salary
//hireDate
//Add the following three methods to the Employee class — each should be virtual:
//getName()
//getSalary()
//hiredDate()

//Each of the above methods should print out the value of the corresponding variable along with a label.
//See below for the output.

//Create a subclass named Engineer that inherits from Employee and includes a new string variable, schoolAttended. Don 't forget the constructor.
//Within the Main method, instantiate a new Engineer object and call each of the methods (from # 2).


//Your output should look similar to the following:
//Employee Name: Rupert Scott
//Salary: 42000
//Hire Date: 11 / 22 / 12



//Part 2
//Create a subclass of Engineer named SoftwareEngineer.
//Within the new class, create a method that will override the getSalary() method and
// print "Salary: Sorry, this employee's salary is private.".
//Create a new instance of the SoftwareEngineer class and call each of the three methods available.
//Your output should now look similar to the following:
//Employee Name: Rupert Scott
//Salary: 42000
//Hire Date: 11 / 22 / 12
//-------------------------------------------------- -
//Employee Name: Shea Rovington
//Salary: Sorry, this employee 's salary is private.
//Hire Date: 03 / 27 / 18
